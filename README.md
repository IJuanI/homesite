### 👁️‍🗨️ Live - https://ijuani.dev/

This is my personal website, originally scoped to serve as a portfolio of the personal projects I've worked into.

I plan to use this as a personal space to write about myself professionally, and start a blog about the things I learn.

Ideally this would evolve into a pretty light but updated learning resource for both new and senior developers.

### 📚 How To Use
